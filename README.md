## Smart-Home-Security-and-Automation
Cisco packet tracer is being used to implement this project because it allows us to simulate different types of networks virtually, especially, wireless networks and
Internet Of Things (IoT) devices. In the Cisco Packet Tracer, the devices appear as they are in reality, and users can monitor and interact with various wireless
and IoT devices.

In order to implement smart security, we used different smart object for security automation such as motion detectors,siren alarm and a webcam. Smart security system is used in a home that include smart object to improve security activities in advance, that can be automating activities of security without user involvement such as monitoring home environment conditions by various sensors like motion detectors etc.

Home Gateway is used to provide controlling mechanisms by registering smart devices to Home Gateway respectively.The smart security system can identify who tries to enter your restricted area and gives you the flexibility to have the control of permitting them in or not.

Room control is characterized by simple operation, high flexibility and the smooth integration into building automation.Room automation is implemented using a fan, light, AC, window and a door. Here, room automation ensures a reduction of energy consumption while simultaneously enhancing comfort.

Smart garden involves the use of technology and automated systems that provide watering in an optimum manner for the plants to grow.
In order to implement the smart garden, we have used a wireless home router and an IOT server, a sprinkler, a water level monitor sensor and a laptop. The sprinkler is set to on or off depending on the water level.
